Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat. Betsy was a very forgetful bat. One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, \"Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry.\"\\newline\\newline\"Do not worry,\" said Twinkles. \"I am going to wait here for you until you get back.\"\\newline\\newlineWith that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned. \"Hmm,\" thought Twinkles, \"I wonder where Betsy went off to.\" Twinkles flew off to find her best friend.\\newline\\newlineSoon, she heard a voice calling from down below. \"Help me! I'm stuck!\" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave. \\newline\\newline\"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!\" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free.\\newline\\newline\"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river. They grow on the bushes there. I wanted some for a little dessert after my lunch. I accidentally walked into the pile of mud on the floor and got stuck.\"\\newline\\newline\"No problem,\" said Twinkles. \"That's what friends are for.\" \n History: Teacher: Why did Betsy stop playing with Twinkles to go home?

After working through the whole weekend he had finally finished. When he got to school he wouldn't tell anyone what his costume was. He even kept quiet when his teacher, Ms. Frazier, asked him.

They rang the doorbell and were waiting for the door to open when a wolf came running out of the bushes nearby. They both shouted and began to run, but then they heard someone say, \"wait for me\" from the same direction as the wolf. When they looked again they saw Thomas standing up and laughing. His costume was so real that it had tricked them both. \"Great costume,\" they thought, \"we'll have to do better next year\" and went off to collect candy from the neighbors. \n History: Teacher: How old was Thomas?

But today the door was wide open, and Max could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground. He had to know why! So Max pushed open the gate to his little house with his nose and walked over to the door. Max was surprised and confused by the ground outside, it was so white and sparkly. His breath started fogging in the air, and the ground was cold and crunchy. \"What is this?\" He asked the rooster sitting on the fence. The roosters name was Omaha, and he was all white except for a big red puff on his head.  \\newline\\newline\"It's snow, son! Did you grow up in a barn?!\" The rooster laughed and flew away towards his little rooster house. \\newline\\newline\"It's so pretty!\" Max said. He pushed it with his nose. \"Oh! It's so chilly!\" He started to take a bite of the crunchy white bits. He wanted to see if they had a good taste, when he heard the farmer. \\newline\\newline\"Max! What are you doing out here?\" The farmer, named Bob, asked. He was loud, but not mad. \"It's much too cold for a small cow like you, we better get you back inside!\" He pushed Max inside the barn, and this time locked the barn door tight. \n History: Teacher: Why did Max leave the barn?

He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted.
