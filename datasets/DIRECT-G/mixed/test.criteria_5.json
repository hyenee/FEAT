Jerry's mother was named Marge, and she was 36. Marge raised Jerry at the railroad tracks because she wanted to keep him safe. She was afraid of the people who lived in the town nearby. The town was named Qarth, and 100 people lived there. Marge believed that the people of Qarth would attack them if they knew they were there. Qarth used to be filled with factories when Jerry was born. By the time Jerry was a teenager, most of the factories had gone away and most of the people worked on special new machines. They ate food from the fields outside of town. Their favorite food to eat was a special kind of corn. They didn't eat meat because nobody raised any farm animals. One day when he was 11, Jerry asked his mother who his father had been. His father's name was George, and he was 2 years older than Marge. Marge looked sad and told Jerry that George had left after he was born because the people in the town didn't like him. This made Jerry very sad. He went off to his corner of the car and didn't talk to Marge again until she went to bed. After she fell asleep he wanted to go out and look for his father. He packed some food and left.

The town was named Qarth, and 100 people lived there. Marge believed that the people of Qarth would attack them if they knew they were there. Qarth used to be filled with factories when Jerry was born. By the time Jerry was a teenager, most of the factories had gone away and most of the people worked on special new machines. They ate food from the fields outside of town. Their favorite food to eat was a special kind of corn. They didn't eat meat because nobody raised any farm animals. One day when he was 11, Jerry asked his mother who his father had been. His father's name was George, and he was 2 years older than Marge. Marge looked sad and told Jerry that George had left after he was born because the people in the town didn't like him. This made Jerry very sad. He went off to his corner of the car and didn't talk to Marge again until she went to bed. After she fell asleep he wanted to go out and look for his father. He packed some food and left. When Marge woke up she was upset, but she thought she knew where he had gone. \n History: Teacher: What fear caused Marge to raise Jerry at the railroad tracks?

During the winter he lives in a nice, warm barn. \\newline\\newlineThe hay isn't as tasty then, but it keeps him fed until summer comes back.  One winter day Max wanted to see what was happening outside when it turned cold and bright. He had never gone out during the winter because the Farmer always locked the barn door behind him. But today the door was wide open, and Max could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground. He had to know why! So Max pushed open the gate to his little house with his nose and walked over to the door. Max was surprised and confused by the ground outside, it was so white and sparkly. His breath started fogging in the air, and the ground was cold and crunchy. \"What is this?\" He asked the rooster sitting on the fence. The roosters name was Omaha, and he was all white except for a big red puff on his head.  \\newline\\newline\"It's snow, son! Did you grow up in a barn?!\" The rooster laughed and flew away towards his little rooster house. \\newline\\newline\"It's so pretty!\" Max said. He pushed it with his nose. \"Oh!

What are you doing out here?\" The farmer, named Bob, asked.

She also loved flying so much because it gave her a feeling of being free.  One day when she was flying around she heard a loud scream for help!  She went as fast as she could towards the screams for help.  She saw another lady bug with a broken wing lying on the ground.  She knew the lady bug as Jessie.\\newline\"What happened?!\" asked Lucy.\\newline\"I crashed into the tree flying home yesterday and I've been lost ever since.  I can't fly because my wing is broken. Do you know the way back home?\" asked Jessie\\newline\"Don't worry Jessie, I know this area like the back of my wing I'll lead you home!\" Lucy said happily.\\newline\"Thank you so much!\" Jessie said happily.\\newlineLucy led Jessie straight home where he was given medicine to fix his broken wing.  She was rewarded a medal and called a hero.  As she enjoyed her medal she knew she didn't need to find for any more ladybugs that looked like her.

Finally, a girl named Samantha went on the radio and said that she found Brian eating lettuce in the Polar Bear cage.  She also told everyone that the Polar Bears were protecting Brian!  For hours, the zoo team tried to find a way to get Brian out of the cage without getting hurt themselves.  Charlie finally had an idea.  He was going to take a stuffed turtle from the gift shop, sneak into the cage, put the Polar Bears to sleep for a little bit, and then place the stuffed turtle where Brian was eating his lettuce.  Charlie's plan worked, but the Polar Bears woke up and weren't happy!  They took the stuffed turtle and ripped it up!  Samantha went to find some fish to make them happy again as Charlie told Brian the turtle to never run off again. \n History: Teacher: What was the turtle eating when they found him?

Charlie's plan worked, but the Polar Bears woke up and weren't happy!  They took the stuffed turtle and ripped it up!

Sally's mother said that they could stop for some frozen yogurt on the way since it was so hot outside. Sally and Jared both cheered. They pulled up to the shop and went inside, the cool air hitting their faces as they opened the door. There were so many different flavors! Jared always got chocolate, because that was Dad's favorite flavor, too. Mom chose strawberry because it seemed perfect for this hot weather. Sally couldn't choose. She really wanted mint chocolate chip, but they were all out. Finally she chose the shop's special flavor \"Tropical Turtle\".

All week my daddy and mommy helped me plan and now it is finally time for fun.  We got a clown and I got to invite all of my friends!  The clown's name was Bob and he was really funny.  Bob made us all laugh a lot.  After the clown left we all played fun games.  We played with a toy filled with candy and all got to eat it.  There were Twix Bars, Milky Ways, M&Ms and Tootsie Rolls.  My favorite candy is Twix so I was very happy to see them inside.  After that, my mom came out with my cake.  It was chocolate with chocolate icing!  Everyone loved it and we even got to eat ice cream too. We were going to eat hamburgers and hot dogs but my dog ate them all before we could. I wish we could have gone swimming in my pool, but it was too cold.  My dad said it was okay but my mom did not want us to get sick.  It was way better than any party I ever dreamed about.  After cake all my friends had to leave except for Timmy.  Timmy's mom said he could sleep over so we made a fort inside and told ghost stories.  My birthday party was the best day of my life. \n History: Teacher: Who slept over and what did they do? Student: The answer is C: Timmmy.
